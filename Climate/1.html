    <h1>CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
    <p>Despite the fact that the terms global warming and climate change are frequently used interchangeably, they refer to two distinct phenomena. Changes in Earth's temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind, clouds, and precipitation patterns over time are referred to as climate change. Global warming refers to the impact of greenhouse gases on the Earth's average surface temperature and is a contributing factor to climate change.</p>

    <h2>Causes Of Climate </h2>
    <ol>
    <li><h3>Deforestation</h3>

    align = "right">
    <p>Deforestation is a key contributor to human-caused climate change. When forests are cleared or burnt, they release the carbon they store. Removing trees also diminishes an important carbon “sink” that takes up CO2 from the atmosphere.</p>
    <li><h4> Air Pollution </h4>

    align = "right">
    <p> Air pollutants have a complex relationship with climate change. Some pollutants, such as black carbon and ozone, increase warming by trapping heat in the atmosphere, while others, such as sulfur dioxide forming light reflecting particles, have a cooling effect on the climate.</p>
    <li><h5> Wildfire </h5>
    <img src="E:/desktop/pexels-rodrigo.jpg" width="150" height="100" alt="lights"

    <p> Wildfires are unplanned burns in any natural environment, like a forest or a grassland. Wildfire can spread quickly, burning through most anything in their path, causing injury and death to people and animals.</p>
